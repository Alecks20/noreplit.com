  <p id="desc"> Over the past few months, Replit.com has changed their pricing drastically to the point where it is
    simply not
    viable.
    <br> We, along with many others, have used Replit for years- however, at its current point we are all looking for
    alternatives.
    <br> This website covers <b>what happened, a comparison, alternatives, and community quotes</b> to help you
    transition away from the
    platform.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>What happened?</h3>
  <section id="whatHappened">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Nerfing Hacker Plan</h3>
      <!-- I'm reading the replit docs, gimme asec -->
      <!-- Hmm, reading about other stuff on replit like egress limits and who left replit because of that, and other ask posts -->
      <p>
        The cutback of "Always On" instances from five to one hit Hacker Plan users hard,
        who used to enjoy five continuous repls but now are limited to just one.
        This shift likely disrupted many users' workflows and slowed down project progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, reducing boosts from five to one negatively affected the user experience.
        While Replit aimed to align resources with costs, this change might have
        eroded the Hacker Plan's appeal, causing dissatisfaction among its users.
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Outrageous AI</h3>
      <p>Replit's enduring focus on AI and LLMs have put them in a state of throwing money at a losing battle. Although
        Ghostwriter is $10/month, it uses the same technology one can get for extraordinarily less from OpenAI.</p>
      <p>Trending Repls have been focused on AI, as well as the company's social media accounts & most heavily, their
        CEO.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>10x Hike in Power-ups</h3>
      <p>
        Replit's price hike for power-ups like Boosts and the Always On feature greatly affected its mostly student and
        budding coder user base. The increased costs, from 2 to 70 cycles/day for a Boost and 2 to 20 cycles/day for the
        Always On feature, made these features less accessible, impacting the learning community.
      </p>
      <p>
        The community backlash was notable, with many finding the new pricing off-putting. This led some to abandon the
        Hacker Plan or even Replit, as the Hacker Plan's affordability, a key attraction, seemed compromised.
      </p>


    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Actually laughable "Reserved VMs"</h3>
      <p>
        The first offender of their Deployments is Reserved VMs. For the lowest tier, <b>you get 0.25vCPUs, 1GiB of RAM,
          and 10GiB of outbound data transfer.</b></p>
      <p>On platforms such as DigitalOcean and AWS, they can be more than 70%
        cheaper.</p>
      <div>
        <div class="comparison">
          <span class="vendor">Replit.com</span>
          <br>
          <span class="value">0.25vCPU/1GB RAM/10GB transfer</span>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="comparison">
          <span class="vendor">DigitalOcean.com</span>
          <br>
          <span class="value">1vCPU/1GB RAM/1TB transfer</span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Intentionally misleading "Autoscale"</h3>
      <p>Replit's version of a worker-like VM is Autoscale. You get <b>3 MILLION</b> free compute "units" per month with
        Hacker.</p>
      <p>
        If you're confused by what that means, everyone else is too. Replit's site says that most projects will use
        under 20 cents a month, however with a DDoS bypass or a "viral Repl", you can easily incur costs upwards of
        hundreds of dollars.</p>
      <p>
        On their pricing page, if you had the <b>Lowest Tier</b> Autoscale running for a full month with constant load,
        you would incur ~$64/month.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Uncompetitive Static</h3>
      <p>Replit's static deployments is just that- static site hosting. Just one small issue, and pay attention- all of
        these sites are free.</p>
      <div class="comparison">
        <span class="vendor">Replit.com</span>
        <br>
        <span class="value">10GiB transfer</span>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="comparison">
        <span class="vendor">Github Pages</span>
        <br>
        <span class="value">100GiB transfer</span>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="comparison">
        <span class="vendor">Cloudflare Pages</span>
        <br>
        <span class="value">"Unlimited" transfer</span>
      </div>

      <i>*Cloudflare's Pages obviously isn't unlimited, however will incur terabytes of transfer before you may get a
        friendly email.</i>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <!-- Don't make them too large! The cards aren't that big... -->
      <h3>Egress Limits</h3>
      <p>
        On April 7, 2023, Replit set egress limits across all plans. Aimed at controlling outbound data transfer, this
        move faced backlash, especially from the Free tier users.
      </p>
      <p>
        With limits set at 10 GiB for Free, 50 GiB for Hacker, and 100 GiB for Pro tiers, many found them restrictive,
        disrupting workflows, particularly for those using free resources for learning and small projects.
      </p>


      <div class="comparison">
        <span class="vendor">Replit.com</span>
        <br>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Replit.dev</h3>
      <p>
        The final blow came when Replit announced that repls could only be run within the IDE, eliminating the option to
        share them outside - now, Replit Deployments stood as the sole avenue.
      </p>
      <p>
        This decision seemed to counter Replit's user-friendly ethos, sparking widespread confusion and shock within the
        community.
      </p>
      <p>
        The announcement led to a significant backlash, drama, and a series of bans.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Misleading Bounties</h3>
      <p>
        The top 50 most "rewarding" open bounties are all stale, having been left open for months with no accepted
        applicant. Replit still shows this on their "60k+ OPEN" tag, show to every user, including students.</p>
      <p>The
        payout is shown in USD and Cycles, but doesn't take into account the 25%-15% cashout fee.</p>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Terrible community management</h3>
      <p>
        The 16k+ member Replit Discord community fell to bits after the moderation team wasn't paid any more than their
        Hacker plan, all nerfed and shiny at $7/month. Understandably, moderators striked, causing Replit to abandon the
        community altogether.</p>
      <p>
        Replit's Reps program was abandoned too, with absolutely no talk of them past the 1st cohort.</p>
      <p>
        Jams were reduced from events like <b>Kajam</b> and <b>#madewithreplit</b> to AI hackathons that a 14 year old
        won with school & no prior experience. Prize pools have dropped from over $10k to around $2k per event, lowering
        the incentive.
